# NHL Game Predictor Dashboard

This directory contains the static HTML dashboard for GitHub Pages.

The dashboard is automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/inference-and-deploy.yml`) which:
1. Runs the inference pipeline daily
2. Generates static HTML with embedded predictions
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

To manually generate the dashboard:
```bash
python scripts/generate_static_dashboard.py
```

The generated `index.html` file contains all styling and JavaScript embedded, so it works as a standalone static page on GitHub Pages.
